![Welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20191790/222938004-af056d30-1ddd-4e35-86ed-bcb0c31b7094.jpg)

> This toolbox is designed to provide a user-friendly interface to perform personalized functional network computation
> Major functions:
> 1. search and organize fMRI files
> 2. compute or load pre-computed group-level functional network (FN) results
> 3. compute personalized FNs, with quality control
> 4. perform statistical analysis to investigate the correlation between FN loading and behavior measurement
> 5. provide both pre-computed and interactive visualization for group and personalized FNs and statistical resutls
> 6. provide MATLAB functions and scripts to carry out computation and visualization of group and personalized FNs
> 7. come with built-in help documents and video

# Additional package needed
> Downlaod workbench from HCP website: https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench
