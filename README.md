# pNet
# A toolbox for personalized functional network modeling

![Welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20191790/222938004-af056d30-1ddd-4e35-86ed-bcb0c31b7094.jpg)

This toolbox is designed to provide a user-friendly interface to perform personalized functional network computation <br />
Major functions:
1. search and organize fMRI files
2. compute or load pre-computed group-level functional network (FN) results
3. compute personalized FNs, with quality control
4. perform statistical analysis to investigate the correlation between FN loading and behavior measurement
5. provide both pre-computed and interactive visualization for group and personalized FNs and statistical resutls
6. provide MATLAB functions and scripts to carry out computation and visualization of group and personalized FNs
7. come with built-in help documents and video

(A) Welcome page for the toolbox. <br />
(B) A module for loading fMRI scans and brain template files. <br />
(C) A module to setup computation parameters for both the group-level and individualized FNs. <br />
(D) Surface-based visualization of both group and personalized FNs (k=17) using HCP S1200 dataset, with left panel showing a binarized atlas generated from the group FNs and the right panel showing five views of three personalized FNs. All the color bars of intensity maps were set from the maximum value of the map to its half value. <br />
(E) Volume-based visualization of both group and personalized FNs (k=17) from Zhenâ€™s multi-cohort iSTAGING study, with left panel showing a binarized atlas generated from the group FNs and the right panel showing a three-slice view of three personalized FNs. <br />
(F) Surface-based visualization of the maximum t value (two sample t-test, FDR correction, p-value=0.001) of sex differences of individualized FNs (k=50) of the HCP S1200 dataset. <br />
(G) A module for quality control, showing one scan with two FNs mismatched to their group-level counterparts. <br />

# Installation guideline
1. Download the whole package and open the pNet.mlapp in MATLAB with version newer than 2021b.
2. The help document (Help_Document.pdf) can be opened on the pNet user interface: click "Help" on the left top menu bar, and select 'Document'.
3. HCP data (.cifti) requires additional pre-compiled packages to read, please follow the section below "Additional Package"
4. Brain template files are stored in subfolder "Brain_Template". It includeds templates for three different brain formats. Please check the section below "Brain Template".
5. Several examples can be downloaded from Google Drive, please follow the section below "Example".

# Additional Package
1. To allow the input of HCP data in cifti format, download workbench from HCP website: https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench

# Brain Template
Note: three widely used brain templates are available in the toolbox subfolder "Brain_Template"
1. HCP surface space: subfolder "HCP_Surface". It contains a single MATLAB file "Brain_Surface.mat" which includes the brain shapes, medial wall index.
2. FreeSurfer fsaverage5: "FreeSurfer_ fsaverage5". It contains a single MATLAB file "Brain_Surface.mat" which includes the brain shapes, medial wall index.
3. MNI volume space: subfolder "MNI_Volume". It contains two MATLAB files "Brain_Mask.mat" and "Overlay_Image.mat".

# Example
Note: fMRI data can easily take more than 1GB space, so we provide examples on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xkCy-0WqYvPA9ooq8txTdc0GsGC-YXMq?usp=sharing  <br />
1. HCP surface data (10 subjects, 2 scans per subject, 400 volumes per scan) in .mat format. pNet results are stored in subfolder "Test_FN17".
2. PNC surface data (10 subjects, 1 scan per subject, 555 volumes per scan) in .mgh format. pNet results are stored in subfolder "Test_FN17".
3. UKBB volume data (10 subjects, 1 scan per subject, 490 volumes per scan) in .nii.gz format. pNet results are stored in subfolder "Test_FN17".
