# This is a brief description of the Python version of pNet
The Python version is designed to carry out the pNet setup and computation.
It has Numpy and PyTorch versions for easy code development and fast computation.

# Deployment
This Python package requires additional toolboxes which can be found in the Install_Toolbox.py
Specifically, it requires:
numpy
pytorch
scipy
nibabel
h5py

# Workflow
This streamlines the setup and computation of pNet, including modules below
1. Data Input
2. FN Computation
3. Quality Control.

# Module
Data Input
FN Computation
Quality Control

# Additionals
Example: It includes example results of pNet on HCP, UKBB and PNC datasets
Brain Template: It includes prepared brain template files for HCP, MNI space

# Example script
Several simple examples are accessible in Example_Workflow.py
